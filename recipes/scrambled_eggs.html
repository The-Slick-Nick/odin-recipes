    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is my own personal recipe for scrambled eggs.
        It is not fancy - it is basic & simple, but it is easy to make, cheap, nutritious,
        and quite tasty.

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Begin by chopping the broccoli into medium-sized (~1 inch width/diameter) chunks, placing
            them into a medium-sized bowl for temporary storage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Begin pre-heating your frying pan - place your frying pan onto your stove burner or hot plate with heat turned to medium.
        </li>
        <li>Crack 5 eggs into a medium-sized bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper to the cracked eggs.
            Stir the mixture toegether using a fork (or alternative stirring device).
        </li>
        <li>
            By this point, the pan should be warm enough to begin sautéing your broccoli. Apply your
            olive oil to the now-warmed pan and add the broccoli into the pan. During the next 
            several steps, stir/sautee the broccoli around as needed using a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>Dice your onion (~80g, 1 small or 1/2 of a large) and add to the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Dice your jalapeño pepper and add to the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Dice your cilantro and add to the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir egg mixture with a fork.</li>
        <li>
            Now, add the egg mixture into the frying pan. Using a spatula, mix and stir the egg 
            mixture with the sauteeing broccoli.
        </li>
        <li>
            Over the next 5 to 10 minutes, occassionally stir the egg mixture in the pan around with
            a spatula, keeping raw, liquid egg in contact with pan surface as much as possible. 
            As the egg cooks and a surface develops, stir and mix the egg around to bring in new, raw
            egg to the hot surface.
        </li>
        <li>
            As the entire mixture becomes solid & cooked, turn the heat on your burner or hot
            down to medium-low and continue to occassionally stir for another few minutes until
            completely cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat off on your burner or hot plate and let the eggs rest for another 5
            minutes. If your frying pan (or alternative cooking surface) has a lid, keep the
            lid on for this period.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve and enjoy!
