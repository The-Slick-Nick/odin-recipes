    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Coffee is delicious and energizing. My preferred brewing method is pourover, which
        I will describe here.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>25 grams of whole coffee beans</li>
        <li>450 ml of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <h3>Required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A pourover brewer of your preference</li>
        <ul>
            <h4>Some examples of pourover devices: </h4>
            <li>Chemex</li>
            <li>Hario v60</li>
            <li>Kalita Wave</li>
            <small>
                Note that the recipe was written with a Chemex in mind, and some of 
                these may be tailored to single-cup brewing, and the 
                ingredient measurements in this recipe may need adjusted accordingly.
            </small>
        </ul>
        <li>Kettle or other heat-safe water container</li>
        <li>
            Stove or hot plate (unless using an electric kettle for the above water container)
        </li>
        <li>Cone coffee filter, bleached or unbleached</li>
        <li>A coffee grinder, if starting from whole coffee beans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Optional/Recommended</h3>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Fill your kettle with water and begin heating on your stove or burner.
            Alternatively, if using an electric kettle, begin heating water in your 
            electric kettle. Aim for 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (90 - 96 degrees Celsius). 
            The ideal temperature to end at will depend on your coffee's roast level - 
            lighter roasts will tend to prefer higher temperatures (closer to 205), while 
            darker roasts will tend to work better with lower temperatures (closer to 195).
        </li>
        <li>
            If using whole beans, measure out 25g of coffee and grind to preference.
            As a rule of thumb, lean toward finer grind sizes for lighter roasts, 
            and coarser grind sizes for darker roasts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once water has reached appropriate temperature, prime your brewing device with 
            some heated water by pouring a small amount through a paper filter, situated 
            and ready for brewing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add your ground coffee into the now-soaked filter. "Bloom" the coffee by
            pouring a small amount of heated water through the grounds, just enough to soak all 
            of them through. 
        </li>
        <li>
            After about a minute of soaking, begin pouring water slowly onto the grounds, making 
            sure to cover them evenly. I recommend pouring in a spiral pattern starting from the center, 
            expanding outward, then contracting inward after the spiral circles reach the edge of 
            the cone filter. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Continue the above step until 450ml of water has been poured. Wait a couple of minutes 
            for the water to continue making its way through the coffee grounds and into the pot, 
            then serve and enjoy!
